            <ul>
                <li>Proficient in most sports</li>
                    <p>Athletics promote balance, flexibility, endurance, sportsmanship, and endurance. You learn to function as a unit in some activities where you are part of a team. Part of this success is working as an integral part of the unit. You balance your strengths and weaknesses to conquer you adversary. You will not reap the greatest reward if you choose to accentuate yourself instead of working together. On the other hand there are sports that are individual. You need to train and control your diet and fluid intake to reach maximum performance. The outcomes from being an athlete all my life has been invaluable. You form great bonds you form with your teammates.</p>
                    <ol>Top sports
                        <li>Softball and HUGE Cardinals fan</li>
                        
                        <li>Cycling (probably should be number one since I rode my bike all day everyday)
                            <p>Loved to fly down the hill on my street with FREE HANDS</p>
                            <p>Other tricks included riding on one wheel</p>
                            <p>Could cover a lot more ground on a bike than from walking. Back in my day the neighborhood was safe. Parents didn't have to worry about their kids getting snatched up by some fool although we were taught to not talk to strangers.</p>

                <li>Sound education</li>
                    <p>You learn a lot from reading books, magazines, web content, newspapers, legal documents and disclaimers, etc. I can't imagine life with a limited reading scope.</p>
                    <p>The key to great communication is having the ability to write a concise statement.</p>
                    <p>The youth of today are taught math in a bunch of creative formats. I'm not sure it is as effective as the way I was taught 2 + 2 = 4 through much repitition. I think we should go back to the basics especially when I go somewhere and the young person doesn't know how much change to give back.</p>

        <li>YOUNG ADULTHOOD</li>
            <p>Advanced education in Lawrence Kansas at the University of Kansas required dedication and grit. Back in the day there were very little resources in Lawrence and no support system. It was like wandering in the wilderness. Fortunately, I was directed to a wonderful little Baptist church and a loving pastor and his wife. This couple and church family were instrumental in providing the support I needed to accomplish the task.</p>
            <p>After completing B.S. degree I returned to St Louis to start my career. My first stop was teaching second grade. You never know what the Lord has in store for you. I met the love of my life at that small Catholic School and we have been together for over 30 years. After that brief detour I got back on track.</p>
            <p>Had wonderful adventures with my older Romeo not from St Louis.</p>   
            <p>My career took another turn when I got laid off for the first time. The company merged with one in Albany NY and nobody moved to the new headquarters to stay with the company. I landed a job fairly quickly at a computer company in ANOTHER STATE. I expected superior systems and support at a computer company. It motivated me to learn how to code and program myself. What the perfect combination. The user and the creator on the same page. </p> 
            
        <li>SENIOR ADVENTURES</li>
            <p>One day I want to go back to that fun leisure life I had as a youth</p>
            <p>The bond with my soulmate resulted in a son. I want to set him up to have a comfortable life. A career in the information sciences world would be a stepping stone for me to that end. It would allow flexibility to build my real estate business which will run itself after it is established and provide an income flow for my son after I am no longer able to work a "JOB". It would allow me to provide financial support in the areas where I am passionate. I would like to assist in maintaining and sustaining life to individuals and families by providing nutritional and spiritual support as well as afforable housing. It will leave a legacy for future generations.</p>
